export const GENERAL_FAQS: FAQ[] = [
  {
    question: "Do you accommodate walk-ins, or is it strictly reservation based?",
    answer: "As a premium custom studio, we operate primarily on a booking basis to secure uninterrupted time for drafting and sterile execution. However, same-day walk-in slots are occasionally available for smaller, elegant fine-line pieces. Feel free to contact our WhatsApp coordinator before walking in!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do we gauge pain levels for different anatomy sectors?",
    answer: "Pain is localized and relative. Fleshy areas like outer shoulders, biceps, and thighs are very manageable (low-medium). Bony or thin-skinned sectors, such as the collarbone, ribs, spine, or inner joints, feel more intense. Our masters utilize slow-stroke breathing techniques and a relaxed beachside ambiance to ease your nerves."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a customized tattoo take to heal under Bali's sun?",
    answer: "Initial epidermal sealing takes 3 to 5 days, while deep tissue healing takes 14 to 21 days. We apply premium Dermalize Pro transparent waterproof medical patches directly after your session. This medical-grade barrier permits shower-proofing and shields your fresh ink from air-borne bacteria, but we highly advise against direct surf sessions or tanning beds for 10-14 days."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your specific chemical safety & hygiene standards?",
    answer: "Devarda.ink operates under surgical-standard hospital protocols. We boast full autoclave sanitizing chambers, absolute touchless washing stations, and 100% single-use, gas-sterilized medical cartridge needles. We use imported, vegan, cruelty-free carbon inks that strictly exceed EU REACH safety guidelines."
  },
  {
    question: "How is billing framed for international nomads & visitors?",
    answer: "We strive to be nomad-friendly. We accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), secure international wires, local QRIS, and direct Cryptocurrency transfers (USDT / BTC / ETH) for seamless, secure transactions."
